TODO
====

- [ ] stow/bin/todo:      # todo: this checks for whether the --file path was specified. This is flaky, extract to somewhere else
- [ ] stow/bin/nt:  # todo: chmod+x should be a lookup table, and not if+if+if
- [ ] osx/start-apps:# todo: rethink the location of this configuration. Maybe in env?
- [ ] osx/apps:# todo: reimplement with brew bundle
- [ ] bls:  # todo: taking json and parsing its contents would be more readable and _better_
